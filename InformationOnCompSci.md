Talking to everyone in lab, I learned that about half the class was unsure about what they were
planning to study and I wanted to provide some resources on CS. Bellow is probably a fit for everyone,
a CS minor would be the easiest 17-20 credits, and a BS in CS or Data Science would be the most difficult.
If you are studying math I would looking to Data Science as there is a lot of double dipping for classes.
